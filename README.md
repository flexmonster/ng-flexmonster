This repository holds the TypeScript source code for Flexmonster Angular module. This module serves as an Angular 4+ wrapper for Flexmonster Pivot table component. 

## Prerequisites 

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

Then install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
